\title{Tetrachoric Correlation for Dichotomous Variables}
\usage{
tetrachoric_cor(df, rows = NULL, cols = NULL, heatmap = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame or tibble containing the variables.}

\item{rows}{Unquoted tidy-select specification of columns to use as the \emph{y}
variables.  Only variables with exactly two distinct non-missing values
are retained.  If \code{NULL} (default), all such dichotomous variables are used.}

\item{cols}{Unquoted tidy-select specification of columns to use as the \emph{x}
variables.  Only dichotomous variables are retained.  If \code{NULL}, all
dichotomous variables are used.}

\item{heatmap}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, calls \code{heatmap_cor()} to display a tile-
based heatmap of the computed tetrachoric correlations before returning
the data frame.}
}
\value{
A data frame whose row names correspond to the selected \code{rows}
variables and whose column names correspond to the selected \code{cols}
variables; each entry is the tetrachoric correlation coefficient
(the \code{rho} element from \code{psych::tetrachoric()}).
}
\description{
\code{tetrachoric_cor()} computes the tetrachoric correlation coefficient—a measure
of the latent-continuous association—between every pair of dichotomous
(binary) variables selected from a data frame.  Optionally, a heatmap of the
resulting correlations can be displayed.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Applicable pairs:} dichotomous–dichotomous (both variables must have
exactly two levels).
\item Estimates the correlation between two unobserved continuous latent
variables underlying the observed binary outcomes, using
\code{psych::tetrachoric()}.
\item \strong{Assumptions:}
\enumerate{
\item Observations are independent.
\item Each binary variable represents a dichotomization of an underlying
bivariate normal distribution.
\item Sufficient contingency cell counts; extremely sparse tables may lead
to unstable estimates.
}
\item Missing values are handled pairwise: each correlation is computed on the
subset of rows where both variables are non-missing.
