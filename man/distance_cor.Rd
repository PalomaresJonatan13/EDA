\title{Distance Correlation Between Continuous Variables}
\usage{
distance_cor(df, rows = NULL, cols = NULL, heatmap = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame or tibble containing the variables.}

\item{rows}{Optional unquoted tidy‐select specification of numeric columns
to use as the \emph{y} variables. If \code{NULL} (default), all numeric columns in
\code{df} are used.}

\item{cols}{Optional unquoted tidy‐select specification of numeric columns
to use as the \emph{x} variables. If \code{NULL}, all numeric columns in \code{df} are
used.}

\item{heatmap}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, calls \code{heatmap_cor()} to display a tile‐
based heatmap of the computed distance correlations (with limits from 0
to 1) before returning the data frame.}
}
\value{
A data frame whose rows correspond to the selected \code{rows}
variables and whose columns correspond to the selected \code{cols}
variables; each entry is the distance correlation coefficient.
}
\description{
\code{distance_cor()} computes the distance correlation—a non‐parametric measure
of association that detects both linear and non‐linear dependence—between
every pair of selected numeric variables from two subsets of a data frame.
Optionally, it can display a heatmap of the resulting correlations.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Applicable pairs:} continuous–continuous (numeric, numeric) only.
\item Distance correlation (\code{energy::dcor}) measures any kind of dependence,
not just linear association.
\item Values range from 0 (independence) to 1 (perfect dependence).
\item Missing values are implicitly handled by computing each pair on their
non‐missing observations.
