\title{Contingency and Joint Relative Frequency Tables}
\usage{
contingency_table(df, var1, var2)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame or tibble.}

\item{var1}{Unquoted name of a non-numeric (categorical) column in \code{df}.}

\item{var2}{Unquoted name of a non-numeric (categorical) column in \code{df}.}
}
\value{
A named list with two elements:
\describe{
\item{absolute}{A data frame of absolute counts (contingency table) with
row names for \code{var1} levels and column names for \code{var2} levels.}
\item{relative}{A data frame of joint relative frequencies (summing to 1)
with the same row and column structure.}
}
}
\description{
\code{contingency_table()} computes both the absolute counts and the joint
relative frequencies for two categorical (non-numeric) variables in a data
frame.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Both \code{var1} and \code{var2} are first validated and extracted as non-numeric
vectors via \code{select_non_numeric()}, and an error is raised if they are
not categorical.
\item \code{NA} values are included as a separate level in the contingency table.
\item Joint relative frequencies are computed with \code{stats::prop.table()} on the
full contingency table.
}

\examples{
# Using the built-in iris dataset (Species only has categories)
contingency_table(iris, Species, Species)

# Custom example
df <- data.frame(
  A = sample(c("x", "y", NA), 20, TRUE),
  B = sample(c("u", "v"),       20, TRUE),
  C = rnorm(20)
)
contingency_table(df, A, B)
