\title{Cramer's V Association Between Categorical Variables}
\usage{
cramer_v_cor(df, rows = NULL, cols = NULL, heatmap = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame or tibble containing the variables.}

\item{rows}{Unquoted tidy-select specification of non-numeric columns to
use as the \emph{y} variables.  Variables may be nominal factors, ordered
factors, or character vectors.  If \code{NULL} (default), all non-numeric
columns are used.}

\item{cols}{Unquoted tidy-select specification of non-numeric columns to
use as the \emph{x} variables.  Variables may be nominal factors, ordered
factors, or character vectors.  If \code{NULL}, all non-numeric columns are used.}

\item{heatmap}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, calls \code{heatmap_cor()} to display a tile-
based heatmap of the computed Cramer's V values (ranging from 0 to 1)
before returning the data frame.}
}
\value{
A data frame whose row names correspond to the selected \code{rows}
variables and whose column names correspond to the selected \code{cols}
variables; each entry is the computed Cramer's V coefficient.
}
\description{
\code{cramer_v_cor()} computes Cramer's V—a measure of association between two
categorical variables—between every pair of selected variables from a data
frame, and optionally displays a heatmap of the results.

\details{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Applicable pairs:}
\itemize{
\item dichotomous–nominal (binary vs. nominal)
\item ordinal–nominal (ordered factor vs. nominal)
\item nominal–nominal (two nominal variables)
}
\item Computes Cramer's V via
\deqn{V = \sqrt{\chi^2 / (n \, \min(r-1, c-1))}}
where \(\chi^2\) is the Pearson chi-square statistic of the contingency
table, \(n\) is the total sample size, and \(r, c\) are the numbers of
rows and columns in the table.
\item \strong{Assumptions:}
\enumerate{
\item Observations are independent.
\item Contingency tables are not too sparse; expected cell counts should be
sufficiently large for the chi-square approximation to hold.
\item Variables have at least two levels.
}
\item Missing values are handled pairwise: each V is computed on the subset of
rows where both variables are non-missing.
