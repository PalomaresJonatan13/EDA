\title{Kendall’s Tau Correlation Matrix Between Two Sets of Variables}
\usage{
kendall_cor(df, rows = NULL, cols = NULL, heatmap = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame or tibble containing the variables.}

\item{rows}{Optional unquoted tidy-select specification of columns to use as
the \emph{y} variables.  Columns must be numeric or ordered factors.  If \code{NULL}
(default), all numeric columns are used.}

\item{cols}{Optional unquoted tidy-select specification of columns to use as
the \emph{x} variables.  Columns must be numeric or ordered factors.  If \code{NULL},
all numeric columns are used.}

\item{heatmap}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, calls \code{heatmap_cor()} to display a tile-
based heatmap of the computed correlations before returning the data frame.}
}
\value{
A data frame whose rows correspond to the selected \code{rows} variables
and whose columns correspond to the selected \code{cols} variables; each entry
is Kendall’s τ correlation coefficient.
}
\description{
\code{kendall_cor()} computes Kendall’s τ rank correlation coefficients between
every pair of selected variables from two subsets of a data frame, and
optionally displays a heatmap of the results.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Applicable pairs} include:
\itemize{
\item continuous–continuous (numeric, numeric)
\item continuous–ordinal   (numeric, ordered factor)
\item dichotomous–ordinal  (binary factor, ordered factor)
\item ordinal–ordinal      (ordered factor, ordered factor)
}
\item Ordinal inputs must be provided as \strong{ordered factors}; otherwise they
will be ignored.
\item Kendall’s τ assesses the strength of a \emph{monotonic} relationship by counting
concordant and discordant pairs.
\item \strong{Assumptions:}
\enumerate{
\item Observations are independent.
\item Variables are at least ordinal.
\item No requirement of linearity or normality, making τ robust to
outliers and non-linear but monotonic associations.
}
\item Missing values are handled \emph{pairwise} (\code{use = "pairwise.complete.obs"}).
}
