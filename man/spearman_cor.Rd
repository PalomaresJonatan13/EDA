\title{Spearman Rank Correlation Matrix Between Two Sets of Variables}
\usage{
spearman_cor(df, rows = NULL, cols = NULL, heatmap = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame or tibble containing the variables.}

\item{rows}{Optional unquoted tidy-select specification of columns to use as
the \emph{y} variables.  Columns must be numeric or ordered factors (internally
converted to ranks).  If \code{NULL} (default), all numeric columns are used.}

\item{cols}{Optional unquoted tidy-select specification of columns to use as
the \emph{x} variables.  Columns must be numeric or ordered factors.  If \code{NULL},
all numeric columns are used.}

\item{heatmap}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, calls \code{heatmap_cor(..., title = "Spearman correlation heatmap")} to display a tile-based heatmap of the
computed correlations before returning.}
}
\value{
A data frame whose rows correspond to the selected \code{rows} variables
and whose columns correspond to the selected \code{cols} variables; each entry
is Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ).
}
\description{
\code{spearman_cor()} computes Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients between
every pair of selected variables from two subsets of a data frame, optionally
displaying a heatmap of the results.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Spearman’s ρ measures the strength of a \emph{monotonic} relationship between
two variables by computing Pearson’s correlation on their ranks.
\item Applicable variable pairs include:
\itemize{
\item continuous–continuous
\item continuous–ordinal
\item ordinal–ordinal
\item binary–ordinal, etc.
}
\item Input columns must be numeric or ordered factors; unordered factors will
be dropped.
\item Missing values are handled \emph{pairwise} (\code{use = "pairwise.complete.obs"}).
\item More robust than Pearson’s \emph{r} for non-linear but monotonic associations
and less sensitive to outliers.
