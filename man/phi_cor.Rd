\title{Phi Coefficient Between Binary Variables}
\usage{
phi_cor(df, rows = NULL, cols = NULL, heatmap = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame or tibble.}

\item{rows}{Optional unquoted tidy‐select specification of columns to use as
the \emph{y} variables.  Only columns with exactly two distinct non‐missing
values are retained.  If \code{NULL} (default), all such binary variables are
used.}

\item{cols}{Optional unquoted tidy‐select specification of columns to use as
the \emph{x} variables.  Only binary columns are retained.  If \code{NULL}, all
binary variables are used.}

\item{heatmap}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, calls \code{heatmap_cor()} to display a tile-
based heatmap of the computed phi coefficients before returning the data
frame.}
}
\value{
A data frame whose row names correspond to the selected \code{rows}
variables and whose column names correspond to the selected \code{cols}
variables; each entry is the phi correlation coefficient.
}
\description{
\code{phi_cor()} computes the phi correlation coefficient (equivalent to Pearson’s
\emph{r} on 0/1–coded data) between every pair of dichotomous (binary) variables
selected from a data frame. Optionally, the results can be displayed as a
heatmap.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Applicable pairs:} binary–binary only (both variables must have exactly
two levels).
\item Each binary factor is internally recoded to 0/1 via \code{as.integer(factor) - 1}.
\item Phi is computed as the Pearson correlation of these 0/1 codes:
\deqn{\phi = \frac{n_{11}n_{00} - n_{10}n_{01}}{\sqrt{n_{1\cdot}n_{0\cdot}n_{\cdot1}n_{\cdot0}}}}
\item \strong{Assumptions:}
\enumerate{
\item Observations are independent.
\item Variables are truly dichotomous (no more than two levels).
\item Adequate cell counts to avoid zero‐division (all four contingency cells
should have at least one observation for stable estimates).
}
\item Missing values are handled pairwise: each coefficient is computed on the
subset of rows where both variables are non‐missing.
