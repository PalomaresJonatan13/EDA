\title{Biweight Midcorrelation Between Continuous Variables}
\usage{
biweight_cor(df, rows = NULL, cols = NULL, heatmap = FALSE, cval = 9)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame or tibble containing the variables.}

\item{rows}{Optional unquoted tidy-select specification of numeric columns
to use as the \emph{y} variables.  If \code{NULL} (default), all numeric columns in
\code{df} are used.}

\item{cols}{Optional unquoted tidy-select specification of numeric columns
to use as the \emph{x} variables.  If \code{NULL}, all numeric columns in \code{df} are
used.}

\item{heatmap}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, calls \code{heatmap_cor()} to display a tile-
based heatmap of the biweight midcorrelations before returning.}

\item{cval}{Numeric tuning constant for Tukey’s biweight function (default = 9);
larger values down-weight outliers less aggressively.}
}
\value{
A data frame whose rows correspond to the selected \code{rows} variables
and whose columns correspond to the selected \code{cols} variables; each entry
is the biweight midcorrelation coefficient.
}
\description{
\code{biweight_cor()} computes the biweight midcorrelation—a robust measure of
association less sensitive to outliers—between every pair of selected numeric
variables from two subsets of a data frame.  Optionally, a heatmap of the
resulting correlations can be displayed.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Applicable pairs:} continuous–continuous (numeric, numeric) only.
\item Requires at least three non-missing paired observations per variable pair.
\item Centers each variable on its median and scales by its MAD (\code{stats::mad()}).
Observations with standardized distance ≥ 1 are down-weighted to zero.
\item Computes weighted covariance and variances to form the midcorrelation.
\item \strong{Outlier Robustness:} Highly robust to extreme values compared to Pearson’s \emph{r}.
\item Missing values are handled pairwise: each pair is correlated on the
subset of observations where both variables are non-missing.
