\title{Pearson Correlation Matrix Between Two Sets of Numeric Variables}
\usage{
pearson_cor(df, cols = NULL, rows = NULL, heatmap = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame or tibble containing the variables.}

\item{cols}{Optional unquoted tidy-select specification of numeric columns
to use as the \emph{x} variables.  If \code{NULL} (default), all numeric columns are
used.}

\item{rows}{Optional unquoted tidy-select specification of numeric columns
to use as the \emph{y} variables.  If \code{NULL}, all numeric columns are used.}

\item{heatmap}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, calls \code{heatmap_cor()} to display a tile-
based heatmap of the computed correlations before returning the data frame.}
}
\value{
A data frame whose row names correspond to the selected \code{rows}
variables and whose column names correspond to the selected \code{cols}
variables; each entry is the Pearson correlation coefficient.
}
\description{
\code{pearson_cor()} computes the Pearson productâ€“moment correlation coefficients
between every pair of selected numeric variables from two subsets of a data
frame.  It can also optionally display a heatmap of the results.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Only \strong{numeric} columns are considered; any non-numeric columns in the
selections are ignored.
\item Correlations are computed with \code{stats::cor(..., method = "pearson", use = "pairwise.complete.obs")}, meaning that each pair of variables is
correlated on the subset of observations without missing values for that
pair.
\item \strong{Applicability:} Suitable for pairs of continuous variables where you
wish to assess linear association.
\item \strong{Assumptions:} Assumes a roughly linear relationship between each pair,
approximate bivariate normality for inference, and homoscedasticity of
paired values.  Outliers can have a strong influence on Pearson's \emph{r}.
